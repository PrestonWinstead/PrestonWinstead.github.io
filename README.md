## My Personal Website

I see you've found my personal website's github repo. I hope that you enjoy perusing it. This project is built with vanilla HTML and JavaScript, as well as Sass to make the styling easier and prettier. It also makes use of gulp to automate the pesky minification tasks.

### This project was build with the help of Start Bootstrap
#### (But changed significantly, becuase I'm good with legacy code)
